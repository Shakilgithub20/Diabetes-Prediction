# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Statistical models to predict incident are often based on variables, Here, I pursued some main goal. Such as, I train an artificial neural network with dataset and predict the diabetes(Target value of 0/1).
# Details about the dataset:
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome.
1.Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2.Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3.BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4.SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5.Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6.BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7.DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
8.Age: Age (years)
9.Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Number of Observation Units: 768

Variable Number: 9
